# Dealer Management System ‚öôÔ∏èüíº

## üìò Project Overview

The Dealer Management System is a backend service designed to perform CRUD operations on dealer data. It enables efficient onboarding and management of dealers, making it ideal for use in car finance platforms. Built with Spring Boot, RestFul API's and Spring Data JPA, this system demonstrates a scalable and modular architecture that can be extended into a full dealership and loan management platform.
